# **Ad-Wall**

Ad-Wall is a simple challenge where the goal is to fill the entire page with randomly sized squares. It started as an experiment with AI assistance, evolving into a fun spatial puzzle.

## **How It Works**
-The page generates random squares of different sizes.
-The challenge is to completely fill the space without leaving gaps or using scroll.
-The randomness creates different patterns each time.
